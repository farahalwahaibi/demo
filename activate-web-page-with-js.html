            FARAH and TASNIM found a recipe in the local newspaper that would inspire them “Original” Cheesecake. 
            Everyone loved their recipe so much that they decided to open a small Cheesecake shop, 
            And because of Covid-19 they moved their baking equipment to a kitchen in their basement and continued to sup
            ply cakes to several of the best restaurants in Jordan.
